The bearer token retrieved from a successful client_credentials autentication is put in the Authorization header of the outgoing request, as per the OAuth2 specification.

OPA reaches out to token_url with the provided client credentials (client_id and client_secret).
On successful authentication, the token server returns a bearer token to OPA.
OPA puts the bearer token in the Authorization header in the request to fetch a bundle.
